# Classification-BloodCells
The goal of this project was to design and train a deep learning architecture for multi-class image classification. Specifically, the classification task involved identifying blood cells: the dataset consisted of nearly 13,000 images divided into 8 classes, each representing a distinct cell type or state within the human circulatory system.
